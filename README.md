Social media platforms collect your data and train recommendation algorithms designed to keep you engaged for as long as possible. Here's the catch:

- 💊 Your feed may become increasingly addictive without being more informative.
- 👥 These platforms collect data about your interests and behaviours, which they might sell to third-party companies.

Sentinel is a browser extension that lets you fine-tune your recommendation algorithms locally, using natural language. Sentinel simply asks you what you want to see and then uses AI to align your feed to your preferences accordingly:

- 🎯 You get to choose what your feed looks like
- 🔐 Your engagement data becomes potentially more private as companies can’t see your final feed
- 🙉 You won’t be distracted by irrelevant posts and will have quick & informative social media browsing sessions
